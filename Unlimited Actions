Understood 👍 — let’s focus **only** on the actions you can run **unlimitedly** (24/7, ForegroundService, no repeat prompts after first approval). Forget the restricted ones (screen share, SMS, clipboard, end calls).

---

# ✅ **Unlimited Actions List**

### 📡 Device Info / Ping / Logs

* No runtime prompt (just `INTERNET` in manifest).
* Unlimited access after install.

### 📂 File Manager (View / Download / Upload / Delete)

* **Android ≤10:** one-time storage permission → unlimited.
* **Android 11+:**

  * **All Files Access (MANAGE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE)** → one-time Settings approval → unlimited full storage.
  * or **SAF (Scoped Access Framework)** → one-time folder pick → unlimited inside that folder.

### 🎙️ Microphone Streaming

* One-time `RECORD_AUDIO` runtime permission.
* After that, you can start/stop mic freely under ForegroundService (user sees mic dot + your persistent notification).

### 📸 Camera (Preview / Photo / Stream)

* One-time `CAMERA` runtime permission.
* After that, start/stop camera freely under ForegroundService (user sees camera dot + your notification).

### 📞 Call Logs (Read)

* One-time `READ_CALL_LOG` permission.
* Unlimited log access afterwards.

### 📞 Dial Outgoing Calls

* One-time `CALL_PHONE` permission.
* Unlimited dialing afterwards (cannot *end* calls — blocked by Android).

### 🔐 Remote Shell (inside app sandbox)

* Needs only `INTERNET`.
* Unlimited use.

### ♻️ Boot Autostart

* Needs `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` + user toggle once.
* Then service restarts on every boot automatically.

### 🔋 Battery Optimization Exemption

* One-time Settings approval.
* Ensures ForegroundService is not killed, enabling true 24/7 run.

✅ So your **UNLIMITED ACTIONS** are:
**Device Info, File Manager, Microphone, Camera, Call Logs, Dial Calls, Remote Shell, Boot Autostart, Battery Exemption.**

👉 Do you want me to now map these **unlimited actions against distribution paths** (Play Store vs. Sideload vs. MDM), so you know exactly which path supports which action without trouble?
